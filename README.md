KONA

 KONA is a completely new crypto currency project. Our developers wanted to create a new cryptocurrency ecosystem and 
 KONA  is the first phase! 

Distribution Phase: In this phase we utilize a fair distribution - evenly divided between Masternodes and miners.. 
Only one million KONA will be minted. KONA is a highly energy efficient proof-of-work cryptocurrency. KONA is based 
on the XEVAN hashing algorithm, which is asic and Nicehash resistant. We've also implement the ZERO coin protocol for 
anonymization to protect coin holders identity, and Hybrid-Masternodes to insure security. Hybrid-Masternodes 
contribute to the fact that KONA is worth investing in as quickly as possible. Block times are sixty seconds, with 
one coin minted per block. 50% reward to the Masternode owner and 50% to the miner. KONA halves at block 75,000 with 
.25 for the Masternode and .25 to the miner. Halving will extend life the life of KONA and increase its market value

During this first we are testing technological innovations and designing a new energy efficient electronic payment 
platform based on Internet-of-Things (IoT), in addition to mobile devices. The main feature of this new 
cryptocurrency is  Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for storing transactions. The 'Tangle' naturally succeeds 
the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and offers features that are required to establish a machine-to-machine 
micropayment system. It will be the first ecosystem of this type in the world, whose coins were fairly distributed.

At the end of the distribution phase, all 1 million coins generated on will be replaced to coins working on the new 
Tangle platform. It will be first of world not mineable energy saving, electronic payments system fairly distributed.
